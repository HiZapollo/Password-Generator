# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

This website was created as a refactor code project for a coding bootcamp class. It is designed to generate random passwords based on a list of criteria, including length, lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. These criteria are chosen by the user, and if the user chooses no criteria the password will default to just include lowercase letters. This project helped me familiarize myself with javascript coding, and exposed me to new javascript functions that allow interaction with elements on the webpage.
